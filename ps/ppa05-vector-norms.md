## Vector norms and normalization

Consider the following vectors $v_i = \{a, b, c, d\} \in R^2$:

a) $[1,2]$

b) $[3,4]$

c) $[1,-2]$

d) $[-3,-4]$

1. Draw the vectors $a, b, c, d$. You can use a single (cartesian coordinate system) 2-d space for that.

b)
#
c)

d)

3. Calculate the L1-norm of the $v_i$.

5. Consider now the set of vectors $v_j \in R^2, ||v_j||_2 = 1$. Choose at least 10 vectors that are as far apart as possible. Draw them in the same graph. What is the shape of the region defined by all vectors $v_j' \in R^2, ||v_j'|| \leq ||v_j||$?
