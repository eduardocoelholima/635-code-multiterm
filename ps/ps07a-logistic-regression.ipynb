Load the data (code provided) and show the shape of the numpy ndarray.\n","2. Plot the data as a 2-D space comprised of the features, with the samples\n","   colored by the associated class (3rd column in the numpy array).\n","3. Create a test split with 20% of the data. Make sure the splits are balanced\n","   or stratified (e.g. the original class ratio is maintained on splits).\n","4. Implement a logistic regression model. You need to use only numpy and scipy. You can not use the already implemented Logistic Regression class from sklearn or or a similar api. Optimize the model using LMBFGS (it is fine to use any algorithm from the BFGS family and it is fine to load the optimizer from sklearn/scipy).\n","5. Present the train and test accuracy.\n","6. Train a least square model with the same train split. Compare test\n","   accuracies between two models.\n","7. Compare the two models using their confusion matrices.\n","8. Plot the decision boundary of the logistic regression classifier.\n","9. Plot the data now with the two prediction regions separated by the decision\n","   boundary as blue (for predicting as '0') and orange (otherwise).\n","```\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sScxfakfqFqf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","!wget https://github.com/eduardocoelholima/635-code-multiterm/raw/refs/heads/main/data/binary_classification.npy\n","data = np.load('binary_classification.npy')"],"metadata":{"id":"2j4WpciIeYTr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"v1rbIxI8ehH7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
